                        <p>We were founded in the height of the pandemic hoping to make masks more
                        fun for people to wear. Our company is a non-profit organization and the
                        money that we make goes back into helping with the fight of covid-19. We
                        take out extra money our company makes and puts it toward communities that
                        are having difficulties due to the pandemic. We are hoping that through our
                        sales we can make a difference and hope to have everyone proudly wear a mask
                    of their own design. Help us make a difference by wearing a mask!</p>
